    Installation guid for Red Hat Enterprise Linux version 9
seed_examples:
  - context: |
      Red Hat Enterprise Linux supports drivers for many hardware devices but some newly-released drivers may not be supported. 
      A driver update should only be performed if an unsupported driver prevents the installation from completing. 
      Updating drivers during installation is typically only required to support a particular configuration. 
      For example, installing drivers for a storage adapter card that provides access to your system's storage devices.

      WARNING
      Driver update disks may disable conflicting kernel drivers. In rare cases, unloading a kernel module may cause installation errors.

      8.5.2. Types of driver update
      Red Hat, your hardware vendor, or a trusted third party provides the driver update as an ISO image file. 
      Once you receive the ISO image file, choose the type of driver update.

      Types of driver update
      Automatic
      In this driver update method; a storage device (including a CD, DVD, or USB flash drive) labeled OEMDRV is physically connected to 
      the system. If the OEMDRV storage device is present when the installation starts, it is treated as a driver update disk, 
      and the installation program automatically loads its drivers.

      Assisted
      The installation program prompts you to locate a driver update. You can use any local storage device with a label other than OEMDRV 
      The inst.dd boot option is specified when starting the installation. If you use this option without any parameters, the installation
      program displays all of the storage devices connected to the system, and prompts you to select a device that contains a driver update.

      Manual
      Manually specify a path to a driver update image or an RPM package. You can use any local storage

      device with a label other than OEMDRV , or a network location accessible from the installation system. 
      The inst.dd=location boot option is specified when starting the installation, where location is the path to a driver update disk 
      or ISO image. When you specify this option, the installation program attempts to load any driver updates found at the specified
      location. With manual driver updates, you can specify local storage devices, or a network location (HTTP, HTTPS or FTP server). 
      You can use both inst.dd=location and inst.dd simultaneously, where location is the path to a driver update disk or ISO image. 
      In this scenario, the installation program attempts to load any available driver updates from the location and also prompts you to
      select a device that contains the driver update.

      Limitations
      On UEFI systems with the Secure Boot technology enabled, all drivers must be signed with a valid certificate. 
      Red Hat drivers are signed by one of Red Hat's private keys and authenticated by its corresponding public key in the kernel. 
      If you load additional, separate drivers, verify that they are signed.

      - question: |
          How to handle installation on systems which has secure boot enabled?
        answer: |
          In UEFI systems with the Secure Boot technology enabled, all drivers must be signed with a valid certificate. Red Hat drivers are signed by one of Red Hat's private keys and authenticated by its corresponding public key in the kernel
      - question: |
          What are the options for adding drivers?
        answer: |
          We can add automated driver update, or assisted driver update or manual driver update
      - question: |
          How to update the drivers manually?
        answer: |
          Manually specify a path to a driver update image or an RPM package. You can use any local storage device with a label other than
          OEMDRV , or a network location accessible from the installation system. The inst.dd=location boot option is specified 
          when starting the installation, where location is the path to a driver update disk or ISO image. 
          When you specify this option, the installation program attempts to load any driver updates found at the specified location   

 context : |
 Registration establishes an authorized connection between your system and Red Hat. Red Hat issues the registered system, whether a physical or virtual machine, a certificate that identifies and authenticates the system so that it can receive protected content, software updates, security patches, support, and managed services from Red Hat. With a valid subscription, you can register a Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) system in the following ways: During the installation process, using an installer graphical user interface (GUI) or text user interface (TUI), After installation, using the command line (CLI), Automatically, during or after installation, using a kickstart script or an activation key.
-question : |
What specific benefits does a registered RHEL system receive from Red Hat, as listed in this text?
answer: |
The text states that a registered RHEL system, identified by a certificate from Red Hat, gains access to several benefits. These include receiving protected content, software updates, security patches, technical support, and various managed services provided by Red Hat.

-question : |
What prerequisite is mentioned for being able to register a RHEL system?
answer: | 
The paragraph explicitly mentions that registration requires having a valid subscription to Red Hat Enterprise Linux.

-question : | 
Can registration only happen during the RHEL installation process? Explain based on the text.
answer: | 
No, registration is not limited to the installation process. While the text confirms registration can occur during installation (using GUI or TUI), it also clearly states that registration can happen after installation using the command line (CLI), or automatically either during or after installation via methods like kickstart or activation keys.

-context : |
The Red Hat Enterprise Linux installer uses the tmux terminal multiplexer to display and control several windows in addition to the main interface. Each of these windows serve a different purpose; they display several different logs, which can be used to troubleshoot issues during the installation process. One of the windows provides an interactive shell prompt with root privileges, unless this prompt was specifically disabled using a boot option or a Kickstart command. The terminal multiplexer is running in virtual console 1. To switch from the actual installation environment to tmux, press Ctrl+Alt+F1. To go back to the main installation interface which runs in virtual console 6, press Ctrl+Alt+F6.
-question : |
What is the primary tool mentioned for managing multiple windows and logs during RHEL installation, and where does it run?
answer: |
The text identifies the tmux terminal multiplexer as the tool used by the RHEL installer to display and control multiple windows alongside the main interface. It runs in virtual console 1.

-question : | 
Besides displaying logs, what other key feature might one of the tmux windows provide, and under what condition might this feature be unavailable?
answer: | 
One of the tmux windows provides an interactive shell prompt that grants root (administrator) privileges. However, this feature might be unavailable if it has been explicitly disabled through a specific boot option or a Kickstart command used during the installation setup.

-question : | 
How would a user switch between the tmux environment and the main RHEL installation interface?
answer: | 
To access the tmux environment running on virtual console 1, the user should press Ctrl+Alt+F1. To return to the main installation interface, which runs on virtual console 6, the user should press Ctrl+Alt+F6.

Swap file systems support virtual memory; data is written to a swap file system when there is not enough RAM to store the data your system is processing. Swap size is a function of system memory workload, not total system memory and therefore is not equal to the total system memory size. It is important to analyze what applications a system will be running and the load those applications will serve in order to determine the system memory workload. Application providers and developers can provide guidance. When the system runs out of swap space, the kernel terminates processes as the system RAM memory is exhausted.
question : |
Explain the concept of virtual memory support provided by swap file systems as described in the text.
answer: |
Swap file systems support virtual memory by acting as an overflow space. When the system's physical RAM becomes full due to the data being processed, the system writes some of this data temporarily to the swap file system, effectively extending the available memory.

question : |
According to the paragraph, what is the incorrect way to determine swap size, and what is the correct approach?
answer: |
The text explicitly states that determining swap size simply based on the total amount of system RAM is incorrect; swap size is not necessarily equal to the total RAM. The correct approach involves analyzing the anticipated system memory workload, which means understanding the memory demands of the specific applications that will run on the system and the load they will handle.

question : |
What consequence does the text describe if a system completely uses up its allocated swap space?
answer: |
The paragraph explains that if a system runs out of available swap space while RAM is also exhausted, the Linux kernel will begin terminating active processes to free up memory resources.
context : A signal 11 error, commonly known as a segmentation fault, means that a program accessed a memory location that it was not assigned. A signal 11 error can occur due to a bug in one of the software programs that are installed, or faulty hardware. If you receive a signal 11 error during the installation process, verify that you are using the most recent installation images and prompt the installation program to verify them to ensure they are not corrupt. Faulty installation media (such as an improperly burned or scratched optical disk) are a common cause of signal 11 errors.
question : | Define a "signal 11 error" or "segmentation fault" based on the explanation provided.
answer: | The text defines a signal 11 error (segmentation fault) as an event where a software program attempts to access a memory location that has not been allocated or assigned to it.

question : | What are the two general categories of causes for signal 11 errors mentioned in this paragraph?
answer: | The paragraph identifies two potential root causes for signal 11 errors: either a bug within one of the installed software programs or a problem with the system's hardware components.

question : | If a signal 11 error happens specifically during the RHEL installation, what is cited as a common cause, and what should be verified first?
answer: | The text highlights faulty installation media (like a poorly burned or damaged optical disk) as a common reason for signal 11 errors during the installation phase. Therefore, the first recommended action is to verify that the installation images being used are the most recent versions and to perform a media integrity check using the installer to ensure they are not corrupted.
